# Anglesey Art Week (Annual Event) 
This is a project I've made for Anglesey Art Week. This project is meant to be private and only shared to trustworthy people, or participants of AAW so long as all rules of it are followed.  

## TODO
- [ ] - Create or find a suitable licence for this project. Until then, this project is not to be taken/used without Damian Hall-Beal's explicit permission.
- [ ] - Tidy up code
- [ ] - Optimise code
- [ ] - Tidy up workspace
- [ ] - No Inline/internal scrips and styles. Put them in seperate files when project is ready for release. (/page/\*.html aren't a priority, and it can be ignored)


All images used are copyrighted by their respective owners/artist.
This project is also not associated with the Anglesey Art Week.
